# PlumeTweaks™ UserCSS

PlumeTweaks™ is a collection of UserCSS styles for various websites I or my friends use.

## Usage

In order to use my UserCSS files, you will need the **Stylus** web browser extension.
> **You can download the extension here**: [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) • [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus-beta/apmmpaebfobifelkijhaljbmpcgbjbdo) • [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylus/)

Once you've downloaded the extension, simply go to one of the userCSS files in this repository and click "Raw", it should allow Stylus to detect the file as a UserCSS and to install it.

## Browser Compatibility

My styles should be compatible with at least Firefox and Chrome, but were only tested on Firefox Developper Edition.
